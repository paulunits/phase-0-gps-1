* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I was still a little confused about creating branches and merging local and remote changes, but after the session, I feel more comfortable with pulling and pushing data into repositories. 

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

The git push and git pull concepts were clarified as well as the creation and merging of branches.

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

The guide helped clarify how to push through changes and pull changes from a remote to local repository so that my pairing partner and I can remain up-to-date on all work and files. 

* What still confuses you about Git?

There's nothing at the moment that I can think of that is confusing me about Git.

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

The experience clarified what it was like to work in a pair. I am now better able to understand how to share work and repositories as well as how to push and pull the changes each user makes so that both parties can be up-to-date.
