##_Jack Shamama: GPS reflections:_  

**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
I have having trouble syncing my local repo to the remote on git.hub. Before our GPS, I deleted my local repo and started over, and it seems to working fine.  
 
** What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**  
Thanks to help from my partner, we were able to clarify merge conflicts.

** What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**  
 He helped us with so much! From basics of getting our screen sharing working on Google Hangouts, to working on catching us making typos, to more specific things like merging branches and the difference between pull/push requests. 
 
** What still confuses you about Git?**  
I feel pretty confident on the git workflow!
 
** How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
 It was great, especially since I'm "new" to coding and not the most confident. I cam convinced there's gremlins inside my computer trying to make things more difficult than they should be. Having someone else to confirm what I'm doing (and correct me when I'm wrong) is tremendously helpful and stress-relieving. I can't wait for the next one!
